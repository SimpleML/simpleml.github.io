### Why did I create SimpleML.org?

> "Machine Learning algorithms are simple, beautiful, and a work of art -- they should be presented like one."

SimpleML.org is an effort to make machine learning algorithms exceptionally easy to understand. The internet is filled with tutorials, slides, blogs, and videos on machine learning algorithms, but I always find at least one of the following missing: clarity, structure, examples, completeness, and visualizations. SimpleML.org tries to fix that.

I don't remember when exactly I got the idea of starting SimpleML.org, but it was sometime in 2015-2016.

### Logo
The shape is called [Sombrero](https://www.google.com/search?q=sombrero+shape). Why this logo? No reason. I just liked it. It can be reproduced by the following [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) code.

{% highlight matlab %}
clear
tx = ty = linspace (-10, 10, 1000);
[xx, yy] = meshgrid (tx, ty);
r = sqrt (xx .^ 2 + yy .^ 2) + eps;
tz = -10 + sin (r) ./ r;
mesh (tx, ty, tz);
surf (tx, ty, tz, 'edgecolor', 'none');
{% endhighlight %}

I am looking for a better logo, please contact me if you can design one. The logo should incorporate the *"machine learning"* theme. It also should incorporate that all articles on SimpleML.org are highly technical yet extremely simple to understand. I am not looking for a [robot logo](https://www.google.com/search?q=machine+learning+images) or a human brain with wires and gears.
