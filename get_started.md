There are thousands of articles on the web to answer this question. I read 100+ of them for you. This post contains my thoughts + summary of those 100+ articles. It contains: *"what really matters"*.

It depends on what do you want to do. If you want to be a ML researcher, or looking for ML jobs, or just checking out of curiosity.

Some things you **must do** without thinking:

* Stanford Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.

Above things are must for any machine learning novice. Just finish them first.

In general, core machine learning algorithms are written in C++ and Python. There are wrappers available for almost all languages.

Say, you want to learn SVM. Start by reading Wikipedia article. You will realize, that is not useful at all because Wikipedia articles are not tutorials, but you will get an idea. For example, for SVM, you will get to know that it is a classification algorithm.
